# About me

I'm a software engineer / data scientist looking for opportunities in the UK/Australia.

I have a Masters in data science and multiple years of experience developing software in a startup environment. 

For my next role I'm looking to continue challenging myself in a fun and supportive environment. I'm particularly interested in roles that involve data science, machine learning, and/or backend development.

In my spare time I frantically keep up with the latest developments in AI and enjoy reading about technology, psychology, and philosophy. I also love <a href="/assets/img/hobbies/IMG_8165.jpeg" target="_blank">hiking</a>, play the <a href="/assets/img/hobbies/IMG_9814.jpeg" target="_blank">drums</a>, am a regular at the <a href="/assets/img/hobbies/IMG_5928.jpeg" target="_blank">bouldering</a> gym, and have recently been generating AI art and writing about it as a creative outlet (see below!)
