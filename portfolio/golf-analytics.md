## Improving Analytics in Golf

Over 2020-2021 I completed a Master of Data Science program at the University of Auckland. For my dissertation I worked on a collection of projects with the aim of improving on the analytics and insight available to golfers. The projects were:

1. Computing novel performance summaries using [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis).
2. Clustering and recommending golfers based on play-style.
3. Adjusting for course difficulty when comparing player performance.

This page highlights the key results from my dissertation. You can also view a
