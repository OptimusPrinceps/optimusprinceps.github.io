# Resum√© / CV

I'm a software engineer / data scientist looking for new opportunities.

With a Master's degree and hands-on experience from an early-stage SaaS startup, I've cultivated a talent for quickly navigating unfamiliar landscapes. By combining research and execution I can hit the ground running and tackle any challenge I am given.

For my next role I'm looking to continue challenging myself in a fun and supportive environment. I'm particularly interested in roles that involve data science, machine learning, and/or backend development.

In my spare time I frantically keep up with the latest developments in AI and enjoy reading about technology, psychology, and philosophy. I also love <a href="/assets/img/hobbies/IMG_8165.jpeg" target="_blank">hiking</a>, play the <a href="/assets/img/hobbies/IMG_9814.jpeg" target="_blank">drums</a>, am a regular at the <a href="/assets/img/hobbies/IMG_5928.jpeg" target="_blank">bouldering</a> gym, and have recently been generating AI art and writing about it as a creative outlet.

Below is my CV. Also available as a [pdf](https://josh-atwal.com/assets/pdf/Josh_Atwal_CV_2023.pdf).

- Title: Founding Engineer
- Timespan: November 2021 -- August 2023 (1 year 10 months)


I was part of the founding team (employed prior to seed-round) of a Saas startup company. 
I followed the company through the prestigious Y-Combinator accelerator program and learnt best practice on how to build a successful startup, achieve product market fit, raise funds, and grow a company.

My main role was as a backend Python developer, but I covered many different roles and responsibilities across multiple different product pivots and iterations:
- _Backend Python developer_: I was the primary developer of the flask backend written in Python. I wrote and reviewed code, architectured the backend, and worked with the frontend team to design and manage APIs. 
- _Data scientist_: I implemented machine learning models to learn on user input and improve the user experience. I was also responsible for visualising and analysing usage metrics to inform product/marketing decisions.
- _Prompt engineer_: I worked directly with the OpenAI and Anthropic APIs to build a generative-AI powered application. I was responsible for designing and testing the prompts used to generate the AI output.
- _Cloud Infrastructure / Devops_: I was responsible for managing the cloud infrastructure on GCP and CI/CD pipelines on Github Actions. I configured Kubernetes for both a stateful and stateless application. I also managed and helped to design the Postgresql database. 
- _Content marketer_: I spent some time generating marketing content for the company in the form of TikTok videos and blog posts. 


Overall, I was relied upon to reliably be able to solve difficult engineering problems. I worked both independently and as part of a development team and managed interns. I was an invaluable member of a small team and really enjoyed having a direct impact on the direction and success of the company.


### [Luma Analytics]()

- Title: Masters Student
- Timespan: July 2021 -- November 2021 (5 months)

For my Masters dissertation I worked with a data analytics company. I used data to improve the analytics and insights available for amateur golfers, and uncover trends in the sport at large.
This involved PCA, clustering, data visualisation, web scraping. The work was highly exploratory and involved a lot of self-directed research with low-touch supervision. 

I received an A+ grade and my work was highly valuable to Luma. It went on to be continued by another student the following year. You can view my dissertation [here](/portfolio/golf-analytics.html).


### [Beca](https://www.beca.com/)

- Title: Computer Vision Engineer
- Timespan: November 2020 -- February 2021 (4 months)


I worked in a team to develop an end-to-end computer vision solution encompassing data labelling, model training, and prediction validation.
I researched contemporary computer vision models before implementing Faster-RCNN and YOLOv5 in PyTorch, tuning them to the dataset, and comparing their performance.

For this role I acted as Product Owner and team leader of a group of three interns. The project had minimal supervision---we met with our supervisors once per week and were responsible for coming up with a sprint goal each week and delivering it. As team leader I did a lot of the planning and delegation of tasks, but was also heavily involved in the technical work.
